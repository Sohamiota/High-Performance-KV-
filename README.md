ðŸ§  **High-Performance KV Store (C++17)**

A fast, thread-safe in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis. It supports LRU eviction, persistence through snapshots, CLI tools, and real-time performance stats.

---

**What This Project Does**

This project gives you a production-ready key-value store, ideal for systems that require:

* Ultra-fast `get/set` operations
* In-memory caching with limited size
* Thread safety for concurrent access
* Binary snapshot persistence for durability
* Custom benchmarks and a clean CLI interface

---

**Main Features**

â€¢ Blazing-fast O(1) LRU eviction
â€¢ Thread-safe read/write using shared mutexes
â€¢ Binary snapshot save/load
â€¢ Command-line interface for manual ops
â€¢ Benchmarking utility to stress test performance
â€¢ Google Test unit tests included

---

**Tech Stack**

â€¢ Language: **C++17**
â€¢ Build System: **CMake**
â€¢ Testing: **Google Test**
â€¢ OS Support: Linux/macOS (with mmap & file I/O)
â€¢ Threads: **std::shared\_mutex** and atomic counters
â€¢ Project Structure: Modular C++ with headers and CPP files

**How to Run It Locally**

1. Clone the repo
   `git clone https://github.com/yourname/kvstore.git`
   `cd kvstore`

2. Make sure you're on a Unix-like system with CMake and g++ installed

3. Run the build script:
   `./build.sh`

4. After build:

   * Launch the CLI app:
     `./build/kvstore_cli --max-size 10000 --snapshot data.kvs`
   * Run the benchmark:
     `./build/kvstore_benchmark --ops 100000 --threads 4`
   * Run the tests:
     `make test` inside the `build/` directory

---

**Key Commands (Inside the CLI)**

* `SET key value` â†’ Store a value
* `GET key` â†’ Retrieve value
* `DEL key` â†’ Delete a key
* `STATS` â†’ Show cache hit/miss/eviction rate
* `SAVE` / `LOAD` â†’ Manage snapshots
* `CLEAR` â†’ Flush all data
* `EXIT` â†’ Exit CLI

---

**Planned Enhancements**

â€¢ JSON config file support
â€¢ Cross-platform support (Windows via MSVC)
â€¢ TTL (time-to-live) expiry
â€¢ HTTP interface (via REST or gRPC)
